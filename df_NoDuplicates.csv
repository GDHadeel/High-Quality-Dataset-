We travelled by high speed train from Makkah to Medinah – covering the distance in just over 2 hours with one stop in Jeddah. 

Stayed at the Sofitel which is the closest to the women’s entrance gate 25 (about 5 minutes walk).

Compared to Makkah, Medinah was so organised and quiet, managed to pray inside the prophet’s mosque with no hassle, plenty of chairs for those that can’t sit down and water barrels all over to take a drink of Zamzam water.

Now for some key points to arm yourselves with.

•	Praying at namaz times is easy to navigate and inside and you can get there at Azaan time and still get a space
•	For men, you can walk past the prophet tomb with no booking required. Entrance is close to the south entrances and signposted. Be prepared to queue but lines are kept moving by security
•	Rawdah – to pray in Noble Rawdah, you have to book on the Nusk app as this is required to reduce overcrowding. This is mandatory and QR code on the app will be scanned. You get a choice of times and arrive about 20 minutes before as you will need to queue. If you arrive too early, you will be turned away.
•	Jannatul Baqi graveyard – no booking needed and there is a path going through which is moving one way. Again lines are kept moving. Entrance is by south west part of mosque by the Lost Children centre.
•	ZamZam water – you can take back home one 5l water which you collect from Jeddah airport or Medinah airport.  Just show your passport at the dedicated section outside of departures to collect the bottle. Note, you should only take the water from the airport as these are packaged for air travel. You can’t open them until you reach your destination. Another note, if you are flying straight home, then the water is not counted as part of your luggage. However, if you decide to do a stopover on your way home (so going to Dubai and then back home), the water on you final flight back is counted with your luggage so bear in mind the total weight

Overall a great trip and an experience to be able to visit these two beautiful places. However, slightly let down by the overzealous guards in Makkah and the inconsiderate people who think it is a race to do Tawaf around the Kaaba – we even saw one man taking a business call whilst walking around, seriously, some people have no understanding of why there are there.",2378,en,319516,http://wmn.gov.sa,,,Masjid Nabawi is one of the most important landmarks in the history of Islam.

It’s an impressive sight and worth seeing. 

However! Important notes:

1. Whilst it is technically possible to climb down into the crater, you are not actually allowed to do so and security to patrol the area. This is because people have struggled to get back out in the past.

2. There is no obvious campsite in the volcano rim and it’s very difficult to peg tents into the hard ground. However around 300m to the north of the crater there are lava flows with sandy beds in between which provide cover and better camping

3. The terrain is hard, stony and ridged. Take a spare tyre and go in a vehicle that can handle rugged off-roading 

4. By day we found it to be sunny and pleasant. At night the temperature dropped and there was a howling wind which others had reported so it wasn’t a one-off! See point 2 above. But take a sturdy and/or low tent

5. It’s quite some way from any significant settlement, so time and plan accordingly if not camping overnight",76,en,2249334,http://alwaba.com/,,,,positive,Nature & Parks

It is still closed to the public.

It all started with the one and only Ahmad Aljuaed, the master of communication. This guy was on top of his game, reaching out to us via email and WhatsApp to make sure everything was set for our last-minute and unpredictable arrival. Talk about being proactive!

     But the real star of the show was our guide, Saad. Let me just say, this guy knows his stuff! Not only did he give us a warm welcome, but he also took us on an epic journey through the history and spiritual significance of Taif, all in flawless English. I mean, Taif has so much to offer, you need a knowledgeable guide to help you learn the warm hospitality of Taif Mecca culture. 

     Now, here's the highlight of the trip ‚the cable car ride to Al Hada Mountain. Oh boy, the views were out of this world! We were floating in the sky, taking in the breathtaking scenery. Trust me, you can't miss this. It's like being on top of the world, literally!

     And of course, being the city of roses, we couldn't leave Taif without visiting the rose oil refinery. The aroma was intoxicating, and learning about the process was fascinating. It's like a sweet-smelling science experiment, but way cooler.

    But wait, there's more! We explored Rudaf Park and Shubra Palace, diving into the depths of history. It was like stepping back in time, only with better Wi-Fi. And let's not forget the shopping in the old souk, sipping mint tea, and snagging unique souvenirs. It was like a cultural treasure hunt, and we were winning!

    To wrap it all up, we indulged in the hearty Taif cuisine, made with locally sourced ingredients. Let me tell you, our taste buds were dancing with joy! It was like a party in our mouths, and we were the VIP guests.

     All in all, this tour was hands down one of the best I've ever taken around the world. The mix of history, culture, breathtaking views, and delicious food created memories that will last a lifetime. So, when you find yourself in Taif, don't even think twice ‚book the Discover Taif City private tour and get ready to have the time of your life. Trust me, you won't regret it. It's a journey worth treasuring forever!

We spent 4 months working with Zahid from a Tabuk Travel Agency (WhatsApp +966553790040) to get permits to allow us to visit.  They cost $20 each, and he obtained them for us, and emailed them to us.  We printed them out and took them with us and the military personnel that control entry looked at the paperwork and smiled and let us through.  I worried something would go wrong, but nothing did.  It was very professional and perfect.  For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, there's a high probability that this is the Valley of Lemuel.  If so, it's where Lehi based his family after leaving from Jerusalem.  It's where the brothers left from to get the plates and the family of Ismael.  Its where Lehi received the Tree of Life vision; where a revelation on the birth, life, crucifixions, and resurrection of Christ was given; where a revelation on the coming forth of America and the Book of Mormon was received; and where the Liahona was given.  It was a pretty special visit.  Moslems believe that this is where Moses and the Israelites crossed the Red Sea.  If you're in the area, it's worth a visit.",4,en,19821001,,,,,positive,Nature & Parks

On the tour there was a man that harassed me, he kept taking pictures of me and saying very inappropriate jokes all while I was there with my babies husband and mother. I feel very disrespected and shocked. This man felt that it was ok for him to behave the way he did in front of my my and husband. 

When we complained to the tour guide (Ziad) who also claimed to be a manager, he told us to go to hell and that’s our problem. He made us go sit in the bus and end the tour. Security was called which I thought was going to solve the problem but that wasn’t the case. The man that harassed me, Ziad, and the security guy all worked together as a team, they were all protecting each other. When we realized they were a team, my husband confronted the man that harassed me and he said he was only taking snapchat pictures and it’s not a big deal, he even showed the picture like it’s nothing. The picture had my family in it. I asked for the US Embassy to be called, I asked for law enforcement to be present as we felt unsafe but none of those requests were answered. We were frightened and scared. They basically bullied us for complaining about the man that kept harassing me. 

We waited for them to respond for two hours sitting in the heat with our children. When we went back to Ziad and asked what was going on he told us go walk home if you don’t want to wait. So we paid for a tour in which we were harassed, bullied and trapped. We never got an apology and I don’t think it would help this case at this point. 

We came all the way from America (Denver Colorado) to visit this site and now we feel so disgusted, upset and disrespected. We will never come here again and report this as sexual harassment. We will not recommend this experience to anyone we know. How can a big organization like this have such horrible and unprofessional tour guides. We complained to several people, sent emails and heard nothing. We were not taken seriously at all.

We arrived here by car, which is essential for a complete and independent visit. The main reason tourists come here is Hegra, which alone is worth a visit than Al Ula. We booked the visits to Dadan & Jabal Ikmah and the Old Town online. For the first one, as well as for Hegra, we parked in Winter park while for the second one we used the Old Town North Parking although we can also confirm that Old Town South Parking is closer to the starting point of the tour. The walking tour of the oasis (oasis trail) can be started from several points even if we have considered the best solution to use the car parking located on the other side of the road at the south end of the Old Town.  Among the things to do at sunset without a doubt Elephant Rock and the Harrat viewpoint are unmissable. Al Ula offers many other opportunities for visits and recreation and among them Rainbow Rock and Maraya cannot fail to be mentioned for its uniqueness. Finally, although now temporarily closed, work has begun to expand and repopulate the Sharaan Nature Reserve where in addition to the present animals (red-necked ostriches, regal Nubian ibex, gazelles and Cape hare) the leopard will be reintroduced. We cannot fail to report the kindness and courtesy of those who live here (who have always supported us with information and suggestions), the ease of movement with car and parking and the absolute safety of this town whose only negative aspect (at least one there must be) are the speed cameras.

It’s a steep mountain. Anyone with back problems of any kind or mobility concerns should not attempt this mountain. It takes 2 hours for an able bodied person to climb and up to 4 hours for anyone else. Rocks are steep and the journey is treacherous winding up the mountain. You are constantly near to cliff edges there are no barriers to stop you falling so you must have good treads on your shoes to grip. You go up and down the same way. Many people will be using the same route as you. There are small hut shops dotted along the route so you can buy water and snacks if yours run out. I highly recommend a sugar fix maybe juice or chocolate to normalise your blood pressure for when you reach the top. There is a snack hut at the top. And no there are no toilets along any of the route. When you reach the top access to the small cave is tiny. Only a few people can fit. There will be a small queue for those wanting to offer prayers inside the cave. Coming down is harder than upwards because gravity will make you go faster. Many people fall and slip on the gravel on the way down. Take it slow. Don’t try and be fast, or smart. You cannot outwit nature. I saw people with diabetes, high blood pressure, old age, mobility issues, cry tears of pain and exhaustion having come so far and have to turn back because the physical pain was just too much to bear. If you have to walk a lot the next day then this uphill climb is not for you. It will leave you exhausted, tired, and ladies will get swollen ankles and feet. Go with a positive mindset. Take it very slow. Good grip shoes or trainers. Take snacks and liquids. Set aside at least 3 to 4 hours uphill. And 2 hours downhill. When you get to the top it is worth seeing and feeling what the Beloved had to go through. A spiritual place indeed. Don’t worship it.

I’m a fairly experienced kayaker in seas, lakes, rivers and rapids and this is the first time I have been discriminated against because of my size. (I would say I’m small-mid fat, US size 16-18) The member of staff told me and my whole group that I should use a double kayak “because of my weight” but didn’t back this up with an explanation. Maybe the kayaks here are cheaper and less sea worthy than others I’ve used previously. I did it anyway to save embarrassment and time because the process of getting us on the water was very slow. As it happened, the girl who shared with me was much smaller and the weight distribution was completely wrong due to this being a double kayak. I felt unsafe the whole time but luckily, as mentioned I am experienced and a very strong swimmer.  Then we had a great time all kayaking together and swimming together, but at the end another member of staff suggested we set up a photo for breast cancer awareness and told us to “form the shape of a ribbon with our kayaks”. She had no idea how to direct this and expected us to just know how to make the shape she envisioned with no help or leadership. We tried for about 10 minutes but all ended up very frustrated and cranky because we couldn’t get this task right. Then we had an equally slow process of getting out of our kayaks as we had getting in them.

The house is privately owned and lived in by Dr Sami Angawi and his family.
Dr Angawi was born in Mecca and is an authority on Saudi Arabian architecture. The house is called Al Makkiyah and was 10 years in the making.
Dr Angawi built his house according to the wind. Capturing the wind from the north to the west, the house uses natural ventilation for half  of the year, throughout  different levels, limiting the need for air conditioning 
The house is constructed from many locally sourced materials. Dr Angawi’s wife Amira is an interior designer and whenever you see interior photographs of the house, you can see just how talented she is.
I discovered that the house is only available for visits and viewing at particular times and for group tours.
There was no such opportunity when I was in Jeddah, other than admiring the exterior of the house.
The research I did allowed me to discover that when there are opportunities for visits to the house the tickets cost around 200 riyals, which I believe includes tea being served to you.
It is difficult to find information on how you obtain tickets to see the house, if indeed this is still possible.

We are drawn to these sacred cities by a desire to explore their rich religious, historical, and cultural significance, steeped in the spiritual aura of Islam. During our recent visit to Madinah, we had the privilege of visiting the house of Syeda Fatimah bint Husayn, a place deeply entrenched in history. She built this house and a well inside it when she moved from her grandmother Fatima's (RA) house. This move was necessitated when Fatima's house became part of the expanding Prophet's Mosque. Syeda Fatimah remained in Madinah while her father participated in the battle of Karbala, where he ultimately met his martyrdom in 110 AH. Fatima was also present in Karbala and was later taken as a captive to Kufa and then to Damascus, along with other members of Imam Hussain's family. Despite the hardships she endured, Fatima played a crucial role as a narrator of the tragic events of Karbala and its aftermath. It is said that Syeda Fatimah's resemblance to her grandmother, Fatima (RA), the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), was striking, adding a poignant layer to her story. Her life and experiences are a testament to the resilience and strength of faith that characterize the descendants of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).",1,en,27551401,,,,,positive,Historical Sites & Landmarks

川岸はナツメヤシが多く植えられ緑化されており、ピクニックができるような公園となっています。付近の日干し泥煉瓦造りの建物は美しく修復され、地面も石のタイルで覆われ、埃っぽさがまったくありません。モスクの周囲は細い路地となっています。

訪問した時は閑散としており、平日で誰一人いない状態でした。サウジアラビアでは観光地ごとにイベント時期が設定されており、ディルイーヤ シーズン(Diriyah Season)は11月から12月(前回は22 Nov 2019 - 21 Dec 2019)で、普段公開していない遺跡や施設を観ることが出来ますので、この付近を訪問するには最適な時期となります。Al UlaのWinter at Tantora Season 2 (19 Dec 2019 - 7 Mar 2020)の終わり近くに訪れましたので、ディルイーヤではイベント時期でなかったことと、ちょうどクラシックカーのイベント準備で周囲が封鎖されていたこともあります。
公園内やモスク入口にわかりやすい看板などが無いので、アル・ザウィハ・モスク (Al Dwaihra Mosque)には、アラビア語が分からない場合ガイドがいないと訪問は難しいと思います。係の方に中に入れて頂き、ガラス越しに室内を見学しました。

スンナ派の宗教学者ムハンマド・イブン・アブドゥルワッハーブ(Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab)は、1744年にディルイーヤのイブン・サウード(Ibn Saud)に迎え入れられ、教えを広めました。アル・ザウィハ・モスク (Al Dwaihra Mosque)がいつ建てられたかは不明ですが、かなり古いものです。サウジアラビアの10個に分類された歴史的モスクの建築様式ではナジド様式(Najdi Style)と、Abdullatif Al Fozan Awardの""Historical Mosques in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Investigating Architectural Styles Typology""で解説されています。10個の内、今回の旅行で他にMimar MosqueとUmar Ibn Al Khattab MosqueとShafe’i Mosquesも訪れており、短期間で代表するモスクを目にできたことが嬉しく感じました。さらにAbdullatif Al Fozan Awardのサイトには、モスクの建築情報を網羅した「モスクペディア(Mosqpedia)」があり、「Dwaihra」で検索すると写真やDrawingsを参照でき、建築好きにとっては大変貴重なサイトです。

また、モスクの修復前の写真を探していたところ、The Royal Commission for Riyadh City(RCRC)のサイトの、Publications内に「Al-Bujairi…Heart of the Call」というアル・ブジャイリ(Al Bujairi)に関する情報が網羅されている134ページの出版物があり、エジプトの建築家Hassan Fathyが1960年代に撮影したモスクの写真が修復後の写真と共に載っています。他にもレンガや修復後の天井が確認できる写真、当時をイメージしたイラストなどもあります。モスク名は「Al Dhuwayhirah mosque」で記載されています。RCRCのサイトにはリヤドに関する資料が大変充実しており、サウジアラビアに関する出版物はまだ少ないので非常に参考になります。ちなみにアラビア語と英語のバージョンがあります。

モスクの修復前の写真を見るまでは、サウジアラビアの遺跡の修復方法は経年を感じさせない程きれいに直し過ぎると思っていましたが、建築方法が日干し泥煉瓦が基本のシンプルな工法なので、劣化した部分を直し通行可能な状態に修復すると、このように綺麗に直すしか方法が無いのだとよく理解できました。このような誤解を防ぐ為に、現地に修復前の写真を掲示して頂けると一目瞭然なのでわかりやすいと思います。",1,ja,23146323,,,,,positive,Religious Sites

First visited fort and palace at the historical port, then to the beach and pier area. We were surprised to see a road sign to Roman theater so went to discover and explore. The site is still under construction but gives lovely views across the coastline and hopefully when finished will be a great venue with water in the moat and toilet / refreshments on site. Glad we visited while in the area. No petrol stations, cafes, shops in the area and nearest toilet facilities we found were at the beach so take these into account when visiting the area.

I recently visited this hotel and had a mixed experience. The atmosphere and ambience were pleasant and welcoming, and the service was good. However, the rates were quite high, which I felt was not entirely justified by the quality of food.

I ordered the chicken jalfrezi and shahi daal, both of which were unfortunately very average in taste. The dishes lacked a wow factor and were quite normal, which was disappointing considering the high prices.

Overall, while the hotel's atmosphere and service were good, the high rates and average food quality left me feeling slightly underwhelmed. Perhaps with a few improvements in the culinary department, this hotel could live up to its full potential.

*Pros:*

- Good atmosphere and ambience
- Friendly and efficient service
- Clean and comfortable surroundings

*Cons:*

- High rates
- Average food quality
- Limited value for money

*Recommendation:*

This hotel has potential, but needs to work on its food quality and pricing strategy to justify the high rates. If you're looking for a comfortable stay and don't mind average food, this might be a decent option. However, if you're a foodie or on a budget, you might want to explore other options.",44,en,ChIJj9Ner5WtqRURLcWtJO7u_AE,,Tabuk,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5Qmmgv93WlrheoOjvrK0nSEG2tdrRi--jKq67=w426-h240-k-no,,neutral,Food & Dining
